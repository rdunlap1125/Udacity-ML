    "**Answer: **\n",
    "To choose appropriate models, we need to consider the following characteristics of the data and the problem.\n",
    "* As mentioned earlier, this is a classification problem, not a regression problem.\n",
    "* The number of samples in the training set (300) is relatively small, and compared to the number of samples, the number of features (43) is relatively large.  The curse of dimensionality may thus prove to be an issue, and we should consider models that work well \n",
    "* In addition to accuracy, we have been asked to consider the speed and memory usage of the model, so we should take that into account when selecting models.\n",
    "* Finally, since the customer has an interest in understanding the model, the explainability of the model is of small concern.  This should not trump the first two considerations in evaluating the models against each other, but is something we might look at if the results are otherwise close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these considerations, I chose the following models from those discussed in the course:\n",
    "* SVM -- Support vector machines work well in domains with a large number of features, and the size of the data set is small enough that the cubic growth rate of the algorithm's performance is not yet an issue.  If the data is very noisy and not cleanly separable, SVM may not work so well -- if this is an issue, though, this is something that our experiments should reveal.  We will specifically make use of the RBF kernel that is the default in sklearn's support vector classifier, rather than a linear kernel; the nonlinear RBF kernel tends to give better results, and our data set is small enough for the performance to not be a concern.  Some general applications for SVM include bioinformatics (e.g. A Review of Support Vector Machines in Computational Biology by Brett Naul) text categorization (e.g. Text Categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with Many Relevant Features by Thorsten Joachims) and image classification (e.g. Support Vector Machines for Image Classification by Olivier Chapelle).\n",
    "* Naive Bayes -- The Naive Bayes classifer also provides good results with small training sets, and the conditional independence assumption causes the algorithm to perform well even with large numbers of features.  While it is certainly the case that our features are *not* conditionally independent (for instance, the education level and job of each parent will have some direct correlation), Naive Bayes is known to work well as a classifier even if the features are not conditionally independent -- but we shouldn't trust the probabilities.  Naive Bayes also works well with noisy data -- so if the data is too noisy for SVM, this may work well.  We will specifically use the GaussianNB classifier with default parameters.  Some general applications of Naive Bayes include text classification (as discussed in the course) and bioinformatics (e.g. A Primer on Learning in Bayesian Networks for Computational Biology by Chris J. Needham , James R. Bradford, Andrew J. Bulpitt and David R. Westhead).\n",
    "* KNN -- K-Nearest Neighbors training time is limited to that needed to load the data, and with a small set of training data, the query performance will also be fast.  It also has the advantage of being readily explainable to a layman.  Finally, it is easily updateable in the future with new data and new features.  A key disadvantage of KNN is that it is known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality; however, if our features are heavily correlated with one another, the effective dimension of the feature set may be lower than the actual dimension; for this reason, I would in particular expect that this might work well in cases where Naive Bayes does not work so well.  Again, we will initial use the default parameters in the sklearn implementation, where K = 5 and the distance function is unweighted. Some general applications of KNN include image recognition (e.g. Application of K-nearest neighbors algorithm on breast cancer diagnosis problem by M. Sarkar and T. Y. Leong) and content retrieval (e.g. Content Based Image Retrieval System using Feature Classification with Modified KNN Algorithm by T. Dharani, I. Laurence Aroquiaraj)"

To measure this score, the provided data was divided into a set for training the models and a set for testing the models, and the F1 score on the testing data was evaluated; optimizing the F1 score on the training data will tend to lead to a model that is too specific to the training data and does not generalize well.  Furthermore, to see how the accuracy of the model would trend as the amount of training data was increased, experiments were performed on increasingly large subsets of the training data.\n",

    "My initial grid search looked at letting k range from 1 to 10, p range between 1 and 2 (i.e. Manhattan metric vs. Euclidean metric) and weights be either 'uniform' or 'distance' (weighting the k points equally vs. weighting based on distance form the query point).  The model tuned by GridSearchCV has n_neighbors = 9 (instead of the default value of 5), p = 1 (instead of the default value of 2) and weights = 'uniform' (same as the default). This tuned model has an F1 score of .8366 for training data and .8138 for the testing data. Surprisingly, the tuned model has a *worse* F1 score than the untuned model in both cases!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an intriguing result.  One explanation may lie in the fact that, if we look at the F1 score trend data in the tables above, the KNN classifier is still in the region where additional training data is providing notable improvements in the F1 score for both training and testing data; we're not converging to an asymptote yet.  When we run GridSearchCV and do the default 3-fold cross validation, we're essentially running three trials training on 200 points and and testing on 100 points -- and the tuned F1 scores are better than the default model F1 scores for the first 200 data points.  This suggests that maybe grid search with cross-validation should be put off until we have enough data points to support the data reduction implicit in the CV steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an experiment along those lines, I wrote a manual grid search over the same parameter space, but without cross-validation on subsets of the training data; in other words, for each point in parameter space, I trained a single classifier on the training set and then evaluated performance against the testing set.  This code can also be found above.  Interestingly enough, in this case, the default parameters turn out to be the best parameters.  This is also a surprising result, though it can be seen as a validation of the default values chosen by the library's developers."
